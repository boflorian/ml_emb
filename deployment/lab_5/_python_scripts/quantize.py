Lab 5: Neural Network Model Quantization

In this lab, you will learn how to quantize a trained neural network model using TensorFlow Lite.
Import the exported model and convert it to a TensorFlow Lite model with quantization.
Options of quantization techniques are:
- weight pruning
- weight clustering
- uint8 quantization
